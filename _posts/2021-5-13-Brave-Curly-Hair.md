The goal was to simulate curly hair using Disney's research paper written for Merida's hair from *Brave*.

* This is the technical paper: https://graphics.pixar.com/library/CurlyHairB/paper.pdf.
* This is the repo for the project: https://github.com/vaishmantha/braveNewHair.
* The presentation for our project with simulation demos is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10f5GF-52E32JyRj2TxI6A--lrAVFjGNAD9MdQ_NBh_s/edit#slide=id.p).
